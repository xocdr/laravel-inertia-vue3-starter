## Workflow Process

### 1. Feature Initiation
1. Business Analyst creates a new feature analysis document
2. Document is reviewed with stakeholders
3. Feedback is incorporated and document is finalized

### 2. Design Phase
1. UI/UX Designer reviews the analysis document
2. Creates initial wireframes and design concepts
3. Reviews designs with Business Analyst and stakeholders
4. Creates detailed UI/UX design document
5. Develops interactive prototypes
6. Conducts usability testing
7. Finalizes design documentation

### 3. Development Phase
1. Developer reviews both analysis and design documents
2. Creates technical implementation plan
3. Implements feature with regular check-ins
4. Updates documentation as needed
5. Creates tests and ensures coverage
6. Submits for code review

### 4. Review and Iteration
1. Team reviews implementation against requirements
2. Usability testing is conducted
3. Feedback is gathered and documented
4. Iterations are made as needed
5. Documentation is updated to reflect changes

## Documentation Guidelines

### File Naming Convention
- Analysis docs: `YYYYMMDD_feature-name_analysis.md`
- Design docs: `YYYYMMDD_feature-name_design.md`
- Example: `20240315_patient-registration_analysis.md`

### Version Control
- All documentation should be version controlled
- Use the Review History section in templates
- Reference related documents and versions

### Cross-Referencing
- Analysis documents should be linked in design documents
- Design documents should reference analysis documents
- Implementation PRs should reference both documents
