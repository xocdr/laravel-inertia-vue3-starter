- Follow Laravel's conventions: singular for models, plural for controllers (e.g., User.php, UsersController.php).
- Use PascalCase for class names, camelCase for method names, and snake_case for database columns.
* Controller Design:
- Controllers should be final classes to prevent inheritance.
- Make controllers read-only (i.e., no property mutations).
- Avoid injecting dependencies directly into controllers. Instead, use method injection or service classes.
* Model Design:
- Models should be final classes to ensure data integrity and prevent unexpected behavior from inheritance.
* Services:
- Create a Services folder within the app directory.
- Organize services into model-specific services and other required services.
- Service classes should be final and read-only.
- Use services for complex business logic, keeping controllers thin.
* Routing:
- Maintain consistent and organized routes.
- Create separate route files for each major model or feature area.
- Group related routes together (e.g., all user-related routes in routes/user.php).
* Type Declarations:
- Always use explicit return type declarations for methods and functions.
- Use appropriate PHP type hints for method parameters.
- Leverage PHP 8.4+ features like union types and nullable types when necessary.
* Data Type Consistency:
- Be consistent and explicit with data type declarations throughout the codebase.
- Use type hints for properties, method parameters, and return types.
- Leverage PHP's strict typing to catch type-related errors early.
* Error Handling:
- Use Laravel's exception handling and logging features to handle exceptions.
- Create custom exceptions when necessary.
- Use try-catch blocks for expected exceptions.
- Handle exceptions gracefully and return appropriate responses.
* Use event-driven approach principles or job logic where logical

Server scripts
- we are running our code inside laravel sail, we have a web, mariadb, minio, mailpit and redis container
- To execute composer commands: ./vendor/bin/sail composer **** (example: ./vendor/bin/sail composer dump-autoload)
- To execute npm commands: ./vendor/bin/sail artisan **** (example: ./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate)
- To execute npm commands: ./vendor/bin/sail npm **** (example: ./vendor/bin/sail npm run dev)
- When needing to restart "npm run dev", you need to kill the node process in sail first: ./vendor/bin/sail exec laravel.test pkill node ; ./vendor/bin/sail npm run dev
